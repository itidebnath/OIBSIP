      <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and she published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is often regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada's foresight and understanding of the potential of computers were extraordinary, especially at a time when the idea of a programmable machine was entirely new.
